CLINICAL POLICY: Repatha (evolocumab)
EFFECTIVE DATE: 01/01/2024
LAST REVIEW DATE: 10/15/2024

I. INDICATIONS
Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for:
- Adults with established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization
- Adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) to reduce LDL-C
- Adults and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia

II. CRITERIA FOR INITIAL APPROVAL
Repatha may be approved when ALL of the following criteria are met:

1. Diagnosis: Patient has ONE of the following conditions:
   a. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), defined as:
      - History of myocardial infarction
      - History of stroke or TIA
      - Peripheral arterial disease
      - History of coronary revascularization (PCI, CABG)
      - Clinically significant coronary artery disease
   b. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL
   c. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) confirmed by genetic testing or clinical criteria

2. Age Requirement: 
   a. For ASCVD or HeFH: Patient is ≥ 18 years of age
   b. For HoFH: Patient is ≥ 10 years of age

3. Baseline LDL-C Level:
   a. For ASCVD: LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy
   b. For HeFH without ASCVD: LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated therapy
   c. For HoFH: LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL

4. Prior Therapy Requirement: Patient has tried and failed to achieve LDL-C goals with:
   a. High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) for ≥ 8 weeks, OR
   b. Maximally tolerated statin dose if unable to tolerate high-intensity statin due to documented adverse effects, AND
   c. Ezetimibe 10 mg daily for ≥ 8 weeks (unless contraindicated)

5. Statin Intolerance (if applicable): If claiming statin intolerance, must have:
   a. Documented trial of at least TWO different statins
   b. Adverse effects occurring at lowest FDA-approved doses
   c. Resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation

6. Laboratory Requirements: Within the past 90 days:
   a. Fasting lipid panel documenting LDL-C level
   b. Liver function tests (AST, ALT)
   c. Creatine kinase (if history of statin-associated muscle symptoms)

7. Contraindications: Patient does NOT have:
   a. Known hypersensitivity to evolocumab or any component
   b. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of transaminases

8. Prescriber Requirement: Prescribed by or in consultation with:
   a. Cardiologist
   b. Endocrinologist
   c. Lipid specialist

III. DURATION OF APPROVAL
Initial approval: 6 months
Renewal approval: 12 months

IV. RENEWAL CRITERIA
For renewal, the following must be demonstrated:
1. LDL-C Reduction: Achievement of ONE of the following:
   a. LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline, OR
   b. LDL-C < 70 mg/dL for ASCVD patients, OR
   c. LDL-C < 100 mg/dL for primary prevention patients
2. Continued adherence to maximally tolerated statin therapy (unless contraindicated)
3. Absence of treatment-limiting adverse effects
4. Updated fasting lipid panel within past 6 months
5. Continued follow-up with prescribing specialist
